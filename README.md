There are two datasets we used in our experiment.

1. # Dataset: Yahoo Webscope S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset

## Overview
This repository uses data from the **Yahoo Webscope** program, specifically the dataset S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0(16M). 
This dataset is a valuable resource for non-commercial research in fields such as anomaly detection.

Due to Yahoo Webscope's strict terms of use, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can request access to it directly from Yahoo.

## Accessing the Dataset
To obtain the dataset, please follow these steps:
1. Visit the [Yahoo Webscope website](http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com).
2. Locate the dataset: S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset, version 1.0(16M).
3. Complete the registration and approval process as per Yahoo's requirements.

## Citation
If you use the Yahoo Webscope dataset in your work, please provide the appropriate attribution as required by Yahoo:
